The Hall Ticket Generation System with Integrated QR code functionality presents a user-friendly interface for secure access to hall ticket information and relevant details. Upon registration, students establish a secure password linked to their email ID, facilitating authentication. Administrators access a dedicated login portal to oversee hall ticket requests and user activities, with the authority to approve or reject student registrations following thorough scrutiny. Upon registration, students fill out the Hall Ticket Request Form and await admin approval. Admins meticulously review submitted details before issuing hall tickets through the website. The system aims to streamline hall ticket management, ensuring data security and efficient communication between administrators and students. Integration of QR code functionality further enhances convenience and accessibility in the hall ticket distribution process.
